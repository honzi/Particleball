---------------------------

A canvas-based particle arena simulation. Duel against an AI opponent, or watch two AI opponents duel, in an arena filled with randomized obstacles and particle spawners. Defend your goal against the onslaught of incoming particles by deflecting them with your paddle. Deflected particles are changed to your color, which then can award you a point if they sneak past the opponent into their goal.
